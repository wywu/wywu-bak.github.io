Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- **About** -->

<p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p>

<p>I am currently an Associate Director of R&amp;D at SenseTime Group Inc., working with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN">Chen Qian</a> and <a href="http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/">Xiaogang Wang</a>, where I lead the product, research and development of XR-Lab and SmartVideo Group with 50+ members. Also, I am a Research Scientist at Shanghai AI Lab, where I lead the group of XR-Research.</p>

<p>Previously, I obtained my PhD in the <a href="https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/index.htm">BNRist Center</a>, Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1161/4014.htm">Qiang Zhou</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1164/4057.htm">Yici Cai</a>.
