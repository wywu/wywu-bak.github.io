Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- **About** -->

<p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p>

I am currently an Associate Director of R&D at SenseTime Group Inc., working with [Chen Qian](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/), where I lead the product, research and development of XR-Lab and SmartVideo Group with 50+ members. Also, I am a Research Scientist at Shanghai AI Lab, where I lead the group of XR-Research.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in the [BNRist Center](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/index.htm), Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Qiang Zhou](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1161/4014.htm) and [Yici Cai](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1164/4057.htm). During my PhD, I spent wonderful times as a visiting PhD student at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/) in 2019, advised by [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/). Prior to that, I had the pleasure to join SenseTime Research as a full-time intern in 2016.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **XR**, with focus on generative model, neural rendering and digital human.
